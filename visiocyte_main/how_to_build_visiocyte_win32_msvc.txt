******** How to build VISIOCYTE (32bit) on Windows 7 (64bit) using MSVC Express (32bit) using command line tool: *************
(last updated 10/29/2015 by Colin)

(-1) Ensure you have checked out VISIOCYTE source code, installed QT (e.g. QT 4.6.2 from googlecode site: the correct project should be "qt-msvc-installer", which has a web site http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/), and installed MSVC on your machine!

(0) VS 2008: launch the "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt".
    VS 2010: launch the "Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)".

(1) Check out VISIOCYTE src

(2) Enter visiocyte_main\visiocyte folder, run "qmake visiocyte_msvc.pro"

(3) Enter visiocyte_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip tiff.3.8.2.1.tar.gz, and extract the four files:
        tiff.h
        tiffio.h
        tiffvers.h
        tiffconf.h.vc (and rename it to tiffconf.h)
    (note A: the actual 32bit tif library has been pre-complied and put in the visiocyte_main\common_lib\winlib folder, so no need to worry about how to build libtiff)
    (note B: the actual 64bit tif library should be in the folder visiocyte_main\common_lib\winlib64)

(4) Enter visiocyte_main\common_lib\src_package folder, unzip the boost_1_46_0.tar.gz and then move its sub-folder "boost" to "visiocyte_main\common_lib\include\boost".

(5) Enter visiocyte_main\common_lib\winlib folder.
    VS 2008: rename "libnewmat.vs2008.lib" to "libnewmat.lib".
    VS 2010: rename "libnewmat.vs2010.release.lib" to "libnewmat.lib".

(6) Enter visiocyte_main\visiocyte folder and run "nmake /f Makefile.Release"

(7) Now VISIOCYTE has been built. You can run it from the location "visiocyte_main\visiocyte\release\visiocyte_msvc.exe".


Additional Note 1: If you have built VISIOCYTE using similar ways before and already have "libtiff" and "boost" header files, you can skip steps (3) and (4).

Additional Note 2: If you want to build 64bit VISIOCYTE using MSVC, you will need a 64bit MSVC compiler, plus using a similar command line window for the 64bit MSVC as 
                   explained in Step 0.
                   (note 10/29/2015: 64-bit builds appear not to work, at least under VS 2010, because visiocyte takes a dependency on a 32-bit library in the Qt demos.)

Additional Note 3: So far the VISIOCYTE plugins have not been built yet. They can be built in similar ways.

************How to build VISIOCYTE (32bit and 64bit) on Windows 7 (64bit) Using MS Visual Studio 2008***************
(1) Check out VISIOCYTE src

(2) Open "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt" (for 32bit building) window or "Visual Studio 2008 x64 Win64 Command Prompt" (for 64bit building) window
	from "MS Visual Studio 2008 -> Visual Studio Tools" menu item in Windows Start menu

(3) Enter "visiocyte_main\visiocyte" folder

(4) Run "qmake -tp vc visiocyte_msvc.pro". This command creates a MS Visual Studio 2008 project file "visiocyte_msvc.vcproj" in "visiocyte_main\visiocyte" folder

(5) Double click "visiocyte_msvc.vcproj" in "visiocyte_main\visiocyte" folder and open it in MS Visual Studio 2008

(6) Choose building in "Release" mode in MS Visual Studio 2008

(7) Choose building in "Win32" (for 32bit building) or "x64" (for 64bit building) mode in visiocyte_msvc Property Pages (by right-click visiocyte_msvc project icon 
	in the left collumn in workspace in MS Visual Studio 2008) or just on the toolbar

(8) Choose menu "Build->Build Solution F7" to build the solution. A popup dialog will appear to ask to save solution file for this project. 
	Just click "OK" in this dialog

(9) Now VISIOCYTE has been built. You can run it from the location "visiocyte_main\visiocyte\release\visiocyte_msvc.exe".

The building method works for both 32bit and 64bit buildings.

******** How to build 32-bit debug builds for Visual Studio 2010 ********

By following the above steps under Visual Studio 2010, you'll wind up with a broken debug build when the compile process hits mismatched values of
_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL between different libraries in the project.  There are two ways to fix this: switch the core project to debug level 0, or
switch the other libraries to debug level 2.  The former seems to cause a lot of broken debugger behavior and a crash at startup, so do the
latter:

(1) rebuild the Qt demo_shared library for debugging:
    (a) open a VS command prompt in [your Qt path]\demos\shared.
    (b) run "qmake shared.pro".
    (c) run "nmake /f Makefile.Debug".

(2) Enter visiocyte_main\common_lib\winlib folder.  Rename "libnewmat.vs2010.debug.lib" to "libnewmat.lib".

(3) For console builds:
    (a) Enter visiocyte_main\visiocyte and run "qmake visiocyte_msvc.pro" as usual.
    (b) Open visiocyte_main\visiocyte\Makefile.Debug, and change references to "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\release" to "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\debug" 
        in LFLAGS and LIBS.
    (c) Run "nmake /f Makefile.Debug"

(4) For Visual Studio builds:
    (a) Enter visiocyte_main\visiocyte and run "qmake -tp vc visiocyte_msvc.pro".
    (b) Open Visual Studio and load visiocyte_msvc.msproj.  Change it to the "Debug" release configuration.
    (c) Open the project properties and make the following changes:
        (i) In Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General, change references to "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\release" in Additional Library Directories to 
            "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\debug".
        (ii) In Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input, change references to "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\release\demo_shared.lib" in Additional 
            Dependencies to "[your Qt path]\demos\shared\debug\demo_shared.lib".

There should be some way to automate steps 3 and 4, but I haven't looked into it yet.  -- Colin, 11/4/2015
