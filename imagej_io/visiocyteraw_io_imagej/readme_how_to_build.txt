To build the plugins to read and write visiocyte raw files in ImageJ, you should:
1. Copy the this folder (visiocyteraw_imagej_io) to your ImageJ->plugins directory.
2. (Re)start ImageJ and simply run the raw_reader and raw_writer plugins in Plugins->visiocyteraw_imagej_io menu.

If the plugins are not in the plugin menu, or if you changed the source code and want to re-build the plugins:
1. Click Plugins->Compile and Run...
2. Choose the .java file to re-build and run the plugin.
