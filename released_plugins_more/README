 
This folder contains several VISIOCYTE plugin demo programs and source codes v0.96.
The license and user agreement can be found at http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/visiocyte .

Assume you are using a Mac or Linux machine, you can generate the plugin demos
by running the command on a bash:

  sh build_plugindemo.sh

The default configuration will be used. Thus for example if you have 32bit Mac 
compiling environment and run 32bit VISIOCYTE, this will generate 32bit plugins.

To ensure rebuilding everything, you can run

  sh build_plugindemo.sh -B

For 64bit VISIOCYTE program, you can run

  sh build_plugindemo.sh -m

If you are using a Windows system and MinGW (32bit), you can run

  build_plugindemo.bat

The basic_c_fun folder contains several VISIOCYTE plugin interface header files. To
ensure the compiling, the relative folder structure should not be changed, unless
you understand how to change the respective include file location in QT project
file.

You may need to change the destination folder in the .pro file(s), -- the folder name 
specifies where the generated dynamic library plugin files will be copied to. For
VISIOCYTE be able to find a plugin, it should exist in a parallel folder to the VISIOCYTE executable
program. 

If you have question, contact the head of the VISIOCYTE project developing team, Hanchuan Peng
(pengh@janelia.hhmi.org).
