#Rivulet2 VISIOCYTE Plugin for Automatic Single Neuron Tracing developed at RivuletStudio@Uni.Sydney, Australia

The algorithm was developed based on the Rivulet2 algorithm developed by Siqi Liu and Donghao Zhang. This development and the evaluation of this algorithm was highly supported by the BigNeuron project.

You can also find the Python3 rivuletpy package at https://github.com/lsqshr/rivuletpy with Rivulet2 implemented. 

It was tested among 2000+ 3D neuron images stacks. For most of the images, it should provide reasonable results. However, it this plugin does not work for you, you are very welcome to contact us on Github or by email: lsqshr@gmail.com & Let's improve it together
