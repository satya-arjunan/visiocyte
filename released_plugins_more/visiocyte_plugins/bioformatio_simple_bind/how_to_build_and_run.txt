To build this plugin, just following the normal Visiocyte plugin's qmake and make procedure.

To run, you need to download the Loci bioformat jar file from: http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads

and also ensure you have java on your machine.

You need to copy the downloaded file "loci_tools.jar" to the Visiocyte executable folder (i.e. where you will find 'visiocyte', or 'visiocyte.exe', or 'visiocyte64.app', depending on your OS.)
