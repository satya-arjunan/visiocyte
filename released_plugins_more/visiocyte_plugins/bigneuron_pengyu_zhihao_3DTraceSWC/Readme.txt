This plugin will generate a swc file under the image directory named IMAGENAME_pyzh.swc
In order to run this plugin, Matlab or MCR(Matlab Compiler Runtime) is needed.

You can use command line ./visiocyte -x aVaaTrace3D -f func1 -p "100 5 2" -i input_image to use the plugin
And need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Matlab Runtime libs. A sample
 start_visiocyte.sh is given where "/home/.../matlab" is the directory for the
folder matlab_plugin(which contains the lib and header file generated from our matlab code)
You can download MCR here http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/
